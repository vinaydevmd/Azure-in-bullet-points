# Monitoring

- Monitoring
  - Act of collecting & analyzing data to determine the performance, health, and availability of applications and their depended resources.
  - 💡📝 Understanding the operation of applications and alerts helps fixing problems before they occur.
- Services in Azure
  - **Application Monitoring**: Application Insights
  - **Deep Infrastructure Monitoring**: Log Analytics, Management Solutions, Network Monitoring, Service Map
  - **Core Monitoring**: Azure Monitor, Advisor, Service Health, Activity Log
  - **Shared Capabilities**: Alerts, Dashboards, Metrics Explorer
- Monitoring costs
  - Use [Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) for a specific resource.
  - Review estimated costs when creating a resource
  - See spent costs through Subscription blade
    - You can task resources Cost analysis with e.g. *costCenter: marketing* to filter in cost analysis view.
      - 💡 Recommended to tag & export.
    - You can see your bill in "Invoices", opt-in for PDF invoices & download (more options available in *Azure Account Center*)
    - External services billed separately
  - Get notifications through Azure advisor or using third party services like Cloudyn for anomalies and overspending risks.

## Azure Monitor

- PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- Pipeline for metric log data coming from any Azure resource provider.
- Fastest telemetry pipeline: Faster than Log Analytics.
- Collected data is saved in Log Analytics to analyze, monitor, visualize metrics and query and analyze logs.
  - *Visualize*: Dashboard, Views, Power BI, Workbooks
  - *Analyze*: Metrics Explorer, Log Analytics
  - *Respond*: Alerts, Autoscale
  - *Integrate*: Event Hubs, Logic Apps, Ingest & Export API's
- You can use alerts to proactively notify you based on rules with Azure Alerts.
- You can access through
  - Azure Insight & Analytics (OMS portal that's now legacy)
  - On Azure portal there's an existing resource called Azure Monitor.
  - Rest API, PowerShell & CLI

### Data types

- Two levels of logs: resource (*metrics*) and platform (*activity log*, *diagnostic log*).
- All data types can be queried in Portal, PowerShell, Rest API or CLI.

#### Metrics

- On resource level
- All numerical values including
  - All Application Insights data / telemetry
  - System health from VM’s (uses HyperV metrics without any configuration)
- Can be visualized & queried
- 30 days free to store & query
- E.g. requests and errors, average response time, infrastructure metrics

#### Activity Log

- On platform level
- "Outside operations" that are subscription-level events
- Previously known as “Audit Logs” or “Operational Logs”
- Determine "what, who and when" for any write operation taken on the resources.
- Categories:
  - ***Administrative***: Every API call to Azure Resource Manager
    - E.g. create virtual machine or delete network security group
  - ***Service health***: Any service health incidents occured in Azure
    - Come in 5 varieties: Action Required, Assisted Recovery, Incident, Maintenance, Information, or Security.
    - E.g. SQL Azure in East US is experiencing downtime.
  - ***Resourche health***: Status of resources: Available, Unavailable, Degraded or Unknown.
    - E.g. Virtual Machine health status changed to unavailable
  - ***Alert***: All activations of Azure alerts.
    - E.g. CPU % on myVM has been over 80 for the past 5 minutes
  - ***Autoscale***: Events in autoscale engine defined by your settings.
    - E.g. Scale up action failed
  - ***Recommendation***: How to better uilize your resources.
  - ***Security***: Events by Azure Security Center
    - E.g. Suspicious double extension file executed.
  - ***Policy***  all effect action operations performed by Azure Policy.
    - Types include audit and deny
- 90 days free to store, fore more send to Log Analytics (["connect" button in Activity Logs blade of Log Analytic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-activity)), archive to storage account ([click on Export to Event Hubs in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-archive-activity-log)) or  stream to other services ([click on Export to Event Hubs in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-stream-activity-logs-event-hubs)).
  - During export you create a Log Profile you control how/where/what is exporreted for how long.

#### Diagnostic Log

- On platform level
- "Inside operations" within the resource
- Resource-specific with common scheme where resources include their own properties.
- E.g. IIS logs, web server logging, failed request tracking
- Can be streamed (to Power BI, Azure Functions etc.), added in blob storage, and sent directly to Log Analytics

## Azure Alerts

- All alert creation for metrics, logs and activity log across Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights
- Separation of operational and configuration views:
  - **Alert Rules**: Definition of the condition that triggers an alert
  - **Fired Alerts**: An instance of the alert rule firing
- Flow of alerts
  - Set-up alert rule
    - Target resource (e.g. storage account)
      - **Signal**: Types are Metric, Activity log, Application Insights and Log
        - You can have multi-dimensional metrics & monitor multiple metrics with a single rule (currently up to two)
    - **Criteria**
      - Logic test: e.g. six-hour period when capacity is over 10 MB
  - Action group (= actions to do)
    - Grouping of different actions to take when the alert is triggered
    - Each action has name & action type e.g. email/sms/push/voice/WebHook/automation runbook
      - ❗ Applied rate limiting:
        - SMS: No more than 1 SMS every 5 minutes.
        - Voice: No more than 1 Voice call every 5 minutes.
        - Email: No more than 100 emails in an hour.
        - Other actions are not rate limited.
  - Set alert rule name, description, severity (can be informational, warning, error, critical)
- Log alerts
  - Defined by Log Query (by Log Analytics), Time period, frequency, threshold.
  - *Number of results alert rules* always creates a single alert, while *Metric measurement alert rule* creates an alert for each object that exceeds the threshold

## Azure Advisor

- Uses telemetry & application configurations to give personalize recommendations and guidance for
  - high availability, security, performance, cost effectiveness *(monitors unused resources and spent)*.
- Common resource, free for all users
- You can download, filter, postpone, dismiss recommendations.
- You can customize by excluding subscription/resource groups, configuring utilization rules (e.g. you can as a subscription owner set CPU to lower threshold)

## Log Analytics

- PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- Log Analytics is renamed to “Logs” and “Log Search”
- You collect, correlate, search, and act on log and performance with data with any schema.
- Business value:
  - *Assessing updates*: From logs can guess average patching time
  - *Change tracking*: Abnormal behavior from a specific account by tracking changes throughout the environment
- Can be pulled from:
  - Connected Azure sources e.g. IIS logs, custom text logs with custom fields, error level etc.
  - Office 365, Azure Automations, Back-ups (fully integrated)
- Push from on-prem/cloud Linux & windows (already installed in cloud Windows VM's) with an agent
  - SCOM (System Center Operations Manager) agents communicate with SCOM Server over TLS 1.2 which forward events and performance data to Log Analytics.
    - You can use script via Azure Automation DSC (desired state configuration)
- Query with a pipe-through language
  - Each data source has documentation (description & name) of its properties.
  - Main query tables: *Heartbeat, Perf, Usage, Event, Syslog, Alert*.
  - E.g.: `Event | where (EventLevelName == "Error") | where (TimeGenerated > ago(1days)) | summarize ErrorCount = count() by Computer | top 10 by ErrorCount desc`
  - Can generate charts  `| render timechart` that can be pinned to dashboard.
- You can connect to Activity Logs in Activity Logs section and query with `AzureActivity`
- Free to store logs for 90 days of charge
  - You can export to Excel, PowerBI, or use API to send data or get.
- Applies if in same subscription, or in same Azure Active Directory.
  - Collect data across subscriptions
    - In customer subscription
      - Activity log (*export button*) => Event Hub
    - In Service provider subscription
      - Logic App (*When events are available in Event Hub -> Parse JSON (Body) -> Compose (Select Body in inputs) -> Send Data (Azure Log Analytics Data Collector)*)=> Log Analytics
