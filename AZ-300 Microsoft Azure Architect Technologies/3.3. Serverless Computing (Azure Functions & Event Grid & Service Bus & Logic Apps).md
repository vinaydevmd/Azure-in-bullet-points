# Serverless Computing

- Abstraction of servers, infrastructure, and operating systems.
- Main flow => An event triggers code, code gets data, and gives output
- Activity based billing => Only pay when you use resources
  - Billing is based just on resources consumed or the actual time your code is running.
- Applications in Azure:
  - _(Compute)_ Azure Functions, _(Storage)_ Azure Storage, _(Database)_ Azure Cosmos Db, _(Security and access control)_ Azure Active Directory, _(Cloud messaging)_ Event Grid, Service Bus, _(Workflow orchestration)_ Logic Apps, _(API Management)_ Azure API Management, Azure Function Proxies: single API surface that calls different functions, _(Analytics)_ Azure Stream Analytics, Event Hubs, _(Intelligence)_ Azure Bot Service, Cognitive Services

## Azure Functions

- FaaS: Functions as a Service
- Built on top of WebJobs SDK.
- No idle capacity charges.
- Execute event-driven code with any programming language.
- Can run locally or in the cloud
  - **Azure Functions Runtime** is free & [open-source](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host).
  - Local development requires bindings.
    - Bindings are a way to provide input and output to the function.
    - A function can have multiple input and output bindings.
    - They're defined in a Json file can have different parameters (queueName, tableName) etc. depending on bound target.
- Auto-scaling
  - Scale controller monitors the rate of events and uses heuristics to scales out/in.
  - ❗ A single function app will only scale to a maximum of 200 instances.
    - A single instance may process more than message/request at a time though.
- **Pricing**
  - **Consumption Plan**
    - Scale out automatically.
    - Billing is based on number of executions, execution time, and memory used.
  - **App Service Plan**
    - Linux only, you pay for the IaaS.
    - Provides cost predictability and warm start.
- By default, a function will timeout after 5 minutes, and a function can run for a maximum of 10 minutes.
- **Triggers**
  - Can be triggered by Event Hubs, storages, devices from IoT hub, custom sources etc.
  - Or with a scheduled by e.g. webhook, API, data processing.
    - Timer is scheduled with CRON expression
- Bring your own dependencies
  - Supports NuGet, NPM etc., allowing use of preferred libraries.
- Integrated security
  - HTTP-triggered functions can be protected with OAuth providers (AAD, google etc.)
- Code directly in portal or use deployments from GitHub, Visual Studio, etc.

### Best practices

- Avoid long running functions
- Use cross function communication
- Prefer stateless functions
- Defensive functions: An exception can happen whenever possible
- For scalability:
  - Share & manage connections
  - Don't mix test and production code in the same function app
  - Use async code but avoid blocking calls
  - Receive messages in batch whenever possible
  - Configure host behavior to better handle concurrency (max outstanding requests, max concurrent requests etc).

## Event Grid

- iPaaS: Integration Platform as a Service
- Fully managed, http-based event routing service for events.
- It connects and integrates all Azure services.
  - You can create events in Events blade of resources (e.g. blob storage)
- Eliminate polling because it's expensive.
  - Long polling: Server waits until the data is available instead of empty directly.
    - it is very expensive in terms of CPU, memory and bandwidth
- Concepts
  - Event Publishers (sources) =>_(through topics)_ Event Grid =>_(through subscriptions)_ Event Handlers
  - **Topic**: Endpoint where the source sends events.
  - **Event Subscription**: what you're interested in receiving
    - Can be filtered
    - Can have expriration date.
- Batching is supported (array of events) and recommended.
- Use case example:
  - Ops automation: New VM created or SQL DB spun up => check whether configurations are compliant, tag, file work items etc.
- You can use custom events
  - Get easy to use UI
  - Native integrated event handlers
  - Uniform consumption of events
- Uses pub/sub model.
  - Can send events to multiple recipients
- Pricing:
  - Pay by number of operations
  - `Published events, + delivery attempts, - monthly free grant (100k) = total operations x $0.60`

## Service Bus

- PaaS for web applications.
- Managed messaging infrastructure across private & public cloud.

### Publish/Subscribe

- Temporal decoupling
  - Producers (senders) and consumers (receivers) do not have to be sending and receiving messages at the same time, because messages are stored durably in the queue.
- Load leveling => producers consumers send & receive messages at different rates.
  - You don't have to pay for a system that is underutilized part of the time.
- Loose coupling:
  - Resilience because messages are durable until they reach the worker.
- Load balancing: bring on more workers as the queue increases.
- Topics and subscriptions: one to many (recievers)
  - Messages can be filtered in topics
- Other features: Others: auto-forwarding, batching, scheduled delivery (delayed processing), and message deferral

### Implementation

- Create namespaces where pub/subs will meet
  - Provides a service + security boundary.
  - Can be integrated with **Azure Relay**
    - Integrates on-premises communication easily.
    - Less intrusive than VPN.
    - Traditional one-way, request/response, and peer-to-peer communication
    - Event distribution at internet-scope to enable publish/subscribe scenarios
    - Bi-directional and unbuffered socket communication across network boundaries.
  - The name provides a unique identifier for the object. For example, sbces12345.servicebus.windows.net
- Create a queue
  - You can select: Message time to live, lock duration, duplicate detection (duplicates won't be accepted), dead lettering (hold messages can't be delivered in another queue), sessions (guarantees FIFO), partitioning.

### Receive events

- _RecievesAndDelete_
  - Simplest, ok if system can tolerate if a message is missing if it  can't be handled
- _PeekLock_
  - _CompleteAsync_ => Message is handled & deleted
  - _AbondonAsync_ => Re-queued

### Pricing

- Premium: Fixed size, predictable performance, up-down scaling,messages up to 1MB
- Standard: Elastic, auto-scaling, message size up to 256 KB.

### Monitoring

- Metrics
  - **Request metrics** counts the number of requests.
  - **Message metrics** counts the messages (active, incoming, outgoing etc)
  - **Connection metrics** active/opened/closed messages
  - **Resource usage metrics** in Premium: CPU/memory size usage per namespace.
- Diagnostics Logs: _ActivityId, EvetName, resourceId, SubscriptionId, EventTimeString, EventProperties, Status, Caller, category (= operationalLogs)_

### Service Buses vs Storage Queues

- Service buses are built on top of storage queues and are more advanced:
  - Clients can use AMQP (ISO standard for queueing)
  - FIFO is guaranteed with sessions.
  - And other features such as batch send, automatic dead lettering, message auto-forwarding, message groups, duplicate detection, sessions, transactions, duplicate detection, durable publish/subscribe.
- In storage queues is REST only, FIFO is not guaranteed, lease/lock is on message level (while it's on queue level in service buses).

## Logic Apps

- Cloud & serverless only to orchestrate workflows.
  - Connects serverless functions and API's.
- Can be integrated with on-prem connectors.
- Integrates data with apps.
- You can manage & manipulate data.
- Many built-in triggers
  - You can have polling triggers, push triggers or recurrence (time-based) triggers.
  - Other built-in triggers include: _HTTP, Request, Azure Functions, Batch, and other Azure Logic apps_
  - Can be extended.
  - Can be triggered time-based (recurrence scheduling)
- 200+ built-in connectors
  - Managed connectors: _Azure Service Bus, SQL Server, Office 365 Outlook, Azure Blob Storage, SFTP, SharePoint Online, Dynamics 365 CRM Online, FTP, Salesforce, Twitter, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Event Grid, .._
  - On-prem connectors: _BizTalk Server, File System, IBM DB2, IBM Informix, MySQL, Oracle DB, PostgreSQL, SharePoint Server, SQL Server, Teradata._
  - For additional cost: _Enterprise Connectors_ (SAP, IBM MQ..), _Integrations account connectors_ (B2B messages via special protocols, XML handling).
  - Each connector has specific actions
    - twitter has => Post a tweet, get followers, get following actions.
- Built logic with
  - Error handlers
  - Conditionals: _for each, condition (if), scope, switch, terminate, until_.
